Python programs to analyze protein cavities generated by CAVER

This repository contains programs for analyzing molecular cavities that have been determined by CAVER Analyst 2.0

cavervolume.py:
Code was developed in Python using NumPy.

This program will calculate the volume of the cavity, which is represented in a PDB file as a series of overlapping spherical atoms.

Usage: cavervolume.py caverfile.pdb
    where caverfile.pdb is the file generated by CAVER to represent the internal cavity

The PDB file must contain records that look like this:
ATOM      2  H   FIL T1210     162.685 171.581 195.827        1.03


water_profile.py:
Code was developed in Python using the Bio.PDB module

This program will create a list of water molecules that lie inside the cavity.

usage: water_profile.py cavity.pdb molecule.pdb
    where cavity.pdb is the file generated by CAVER and molecule.pdb is the molecule containing the cavity and the water molecules

Output:
    tunnel_conv.pdb  - this is a conversion of the caver PDB file in which each atom is assigned a unique residue number
    tunnel_profile.dat - this is a list of the atoms representing the cavity with their relative distance along the profile
    tunnel_waters.dat - this is a list of water molecules that reside within the cavity
        x coordinate represents their location along the tunnel profile
      	y coordinate represents their distance from the center of the cavity
    tunnel_water_distr.dat - this contains a list of neighboring water molecules with their distances
